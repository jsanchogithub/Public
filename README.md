# Under construction!

# Welcome!

This is the (single) point of entry for my github public repositories. I put all this staff in guthub for helping me on my work in several computers.
I was tired of copying files among computers with the pen-drive :-) 
Besides that, I can share my work. This way, I would be glad if you find here something helpful for you, or something of your interest!
Some pls are just to mark place. Just for organize all toguether.
It is my purpose to add the pieces while I am traning.
