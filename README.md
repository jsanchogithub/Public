# Welcome!

Hi! This is the (single) point of entry for my github public repositories. 
I've decided tu put all this staff in github in order to solve the two big problems I faced when learning pls:
1.- cross-comunication among computers. I work in 4 computers. I have to have always the possibility 'update' 
I was tired of copying files among computers with the pen-drive :-) 
2.- along the time. One of my problems when practicing is that I can achive a 'almost-expert' level in a time. But then, I stop practicing for a longtime
(six months, a year). Of course, when I 'come-back', It is a hard work to remember and restart at the point I left. 

Even worse: 1+2 > 3! When I come back some time afeter,   I do not remember which computer had the last work. 
So, github comes to help. 

Besides that, I can share my work. This way, 
For now, some repositorie are just to mark place. Just for organize all toguether.
It is my purpose to add the pieces step by step.


Well, I am a developer. So, in here, you will find some staff regarding to programming languages.
I would be glad if you find here something helpful for you, or something of your interest!
